## Design System - Atomic Design

This project follows the principles of Atomic Design. Atomic Design breaks down components into smaller, reusable building blocks, which are then combined to create more complex components. The design system is organized into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

For more information on Atomic Design, refer to [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/).

## Styling - Styled Components

Styled Components is used for styling in this project. Styled Components allows for the creation of dynamic styles using JavaScript and ensures component-level styling isolation.

For more information on Styled Components, refer to [Styled Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/).
